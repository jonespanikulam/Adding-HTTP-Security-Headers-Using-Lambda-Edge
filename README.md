Adding HTTP Security Headers Using Lambda@Edge and Amazon CloudFront

***Description:***

Response headers are added to improve the security and privacy of both viewers and content providers. Security headers are a group of headers in the HTTP response from a server that tell your browser how to behave when handling your site’s content.Adding security response headers is often achievable by modifications to your application configuration. Here we will achieve the same result when you have an application that can’t be modified at the origin (e.g., a web site hosted in Amazon S3).
